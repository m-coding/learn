Tutorial by Mozilla Developer Network. Completed this to get a better understanding of `<canvas>` before making my own arcade game project.

HTML canvas is fun! And playing the game was fun too. The keyboard and mouse functionality have given me some ideas for the game I want to create for my upcoming project.
