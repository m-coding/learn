# Parallax

### What is parallax?
The effect whereby the position or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions, e.g., through the viewfinder and the lens of a camera.

### What is parallax design?
The term “parallax” first came from the visual effect of 2D side scrolling videogames that used different background image movement speeds to create the illusion of depth during gameplay. This was generally done by making the background of the game move slower than the foreground in order to make it seem further away. This same concept applies to parallax site design in which the background of the website moves at a different speed as the rest of the page for an impressive visual effect that allows for countless creative applications for online storytelling.<sup>[1](https://www.unleashed-technologies.com/blog/2013/08/15/what-parallax-web-design-%E2%80%93-definitions-tips-considerations)</sup>

### What is parallax scrolling?
Parallax scrolling is a term ascribed to the visual effect of your background image moving slower than an image placed in your foreground. Your end result is a background that dramatically reveals itself at a slower pace than the rest of your page.<sup>[2](http://www.wix.com/blog/2015/10/captivate-your-site-viewers-with-parallax-scrolling/)</sup>

### How it works
The effect is achieved by creating a perspective shift in the way an observer views an object. When creating parallax effect, the aim is to create multiple viewpoints from which you can observe an object against a far-flung background.<sup>[3](http://cyberchimps.com/parallax-web-design/)</sup>

### Methods for creating parallax
Parallax scrolling can be achieved through a couple of methods.

Raster: This method entails compositing and refreshing pixel lines in an image in a top to bottom order. A small delay is introduced between drawing individual lines.

Layers Method: In this method, multiple layers are defined and made to move vertically or horizontally while scrolling at different speeds. Layer movement may be automatic or user-controlled.

Pattern Manipulation: This method creates parallax by floating multiple screens over repeated backgrounds.

Sprite: This method entails compositing various images into one that’s made of pseudo-layers. By positioning the image at different angles, only one part of it will be visible. This method also creates a 3-dimensional effect on flat images.<sup>[4](http://cyberchimps.com/parallax-web-design/)</sup>
